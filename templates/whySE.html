        <hr />
        <p>
          First of all, I love learning and problem-solving.  I took a philosophy of science course when I was a junior at Abilene Christian University, and it changed my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's why I am doing what I do now--working in the sciences.
        </p>
        <p>
          There, I majored in Philosophy, Linguistics (with a computational focus), and English Composition and Literature. My love of natural languages and critical thinking brought me to a natural reorientation. The languages of mathematics and computer science suddenly came into view.
          Through the philosophy of science course, it became abundantly clear to me that mathematics is the essential language by which physics, engineering, and computer science are done.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recall walking through the library and perusing the mathematics and physics journals fundamentally curious about how the authors were speaking to one another through the vehicle of symbols, deduction, and structure. Somehow there was some semantic exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
          There, I discovered Div, Grad, and Curl, all of which are essential to the language electrodynamics. I found groups, representations, symmetries, rings, and fields. I also found the real continuum on which real analysis dances and plays.
          And there were Gödel and Cantor's proofs-- the former having to do with the inherent incompleteness in mathematics and the other having to do with the very unintuitive idea that there is an infinity of infinities, each with differing sizes. Wrap your head around that.
        </p>
        <p>
          It became very apparent to me that what I needed to be doing was learning to speak and use these languages. The transition into mathematics and from there into computer science was very natural indeed. And I am having a brilliant time exploring the vistas each offers.
          In particular,  I am exhilarated by the prospect of a lifetime of practical contribution in the fields I adore most. Being the life-long learner that I am, my motto is: "Experiment. Fail. Learn! Repeat. Succeed." And software engineering is a field I can most earnestly pursue my passion.
        </p>
           <!--May I do so for the duration of my human experience!-->

      <b>TO BE CONTINUED . . . 04/29/22</b>
        <!-- <p>My avatar in the navbar is of Kurt Gödel in the days when he would walk around the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton with
        the great Einstein. Jim Holt writes in his, "When Einstein Walked with Gödel," that Einstein is known for having said he comes to work
        just so he can talk to Gödel. And so they did. They walked and talked. (See picture).</p>
        <br />
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/images/einstein_godel_walking.jpg') }}" class="responsiveGodel img-thumbnail" alt="E&G walking">
      <br />
            <br />
      <p>Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems paper in 1931 set the stage for what would later be Turing's Halting problem. I recommend this book
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computability-Logic-George-S-Boolos/dp/0521701465/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=computability+and+logic&qid=1631577270&sr=8-2">"Computability and Logic"</a>
      for more information. It's fascinating to say the least that lonesome theorems in logic would have something "say" about both the structure
      of mathematics and computing. Gödel "passes the torch" to Alan Turing, and from Turing's work we find the inception of today's information processing devices.
      </p>
      <p>So my introduction to computer science is a bit windy to say the least. It began in theory of discourse update semantics in
      computational linguistics on which I wrote a lengthy capstone paper in summer 2008 for the Abilene Christian University honors department (<a href="{{ url_for('static', filename="css/images/essay2.pdf") }}">paper 1</a>, <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename="css/images/essay1.pdf") }}">paper 2</a>).
      From there I discovered myself on a journey into mathematics and logic itself, a journey which continues today. Futher roads led to the very practical world of computational physics research at Vanderbilt University where I was on a theory team for several months. There, we studied the physical properties of graphene nanotubule
      electron transport phenomena. At the time, my physics education was nascent at best--I had only had Engineering Physics I. So my understanding of how to <tt>ssh</tt> into the parallel computer network in the theoretical physics lab and calculate eigenvalues for the ground-state of an electron using Fortran was sketchy at best.
      But I learned how to work hard "in the dark", so to speak, and the challenge was definitely rewarding. The power of computational methods to probe the quantum astounded me. I had to know <i>more</i> about it all.
      </p>
            <p>On my resume, you find will a lot about my intellectual journey. You'll have also find the usual suspects--for instance, work history,
            education, accolades, etc. Nevertheless, I've also provided an abbreviated version of each of these facets of my curiosity in the navbar tabs above.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, I've spent the last 3-4 years wresting my journey down from the proverbial aether into a much more satisfyingly terrestrial and practical domain of interests.
            And, wow, can I say I'm loving it! I simply cannot wait to work as a software engineer.</p> -->
