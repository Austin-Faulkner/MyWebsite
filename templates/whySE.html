        <hr />
        <p>
          First of all, I love learning and problem-solving.  I took a philosophy of science course when I was a junior at Abilene Christian University, and it changed my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's why I am doing what I do now--working in the sciences.
        </p>
        <p>
          There, I majored in Philosophy, Linguistics (with a computational focus), and English Composition and Literature. My love of natural languages and critical thinking brought me to a natural reorientation. The languages of mathematics and computer science suddenly came into view.
          Through the philosophy of science course, it became abundantly clear to me that mathematics is the essential language by which physics, engineering, and computer science are done.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recall walking through the library and perusing the mathematics and physics journals fundamentally curious about how the authors were speaking to one another through the vehicle of symbols, deduction, and structure. Somehow there was some semantic exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
          There, I discovered Div, Grad, and Curl, all of which are essential to the language electrodynamics. I found groups, representations, symmetries, rings, and fields. I also found the real continuum on which real analysis dances and plays.
          And there were GÃ¶del and Cantor's proofs-- the former having to do with the inherent incompleteness in mathematics and the other having to do with the very unintuitive idea that there is an infinity of infinities, each with differing sizes. Wrap your head around that.
        </p>
        <p>
          It became very apparent to me that what I needed to be doing was learning to speak and use these languages. The transition into mathematics and from there into computer science was very natural indeed. And I am having a brilliant time exploring the vistas each offers.
          In particular,  I am exhilarated by the prospect of a lifetime of practical contribution in the fields I adore most. Being the life-long learner that I am, my motto is: "Experiment. Fail. Learn! Repeat. Succeed." And software engineering is a field I can most earnestly pursue my passion.
        </p>
           <!--May I do so for the duration of my human experience!-->

      Artificial languages (ALs)--for example, programming languages and mathematics--excite me. One of the many goals of an AL is to structure a problem so that it can be solved. Often this is done in the form of modeling the domain of interest.
      In mathematics, models are either built of mathematical structures themselves or models are defined in the service of another science, the example <i>par excellence</i> being physics. In computer science, programming languages model anything from
      machine needs to "real world" data tasks. Let's make this more concrete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Say we want to model terminal nagivation for airplanes in flight. It's in everyone's interest to minimize flight time and queueing so as to reduce cost. For the flight navigation problem we might wish to use
      Dijkstra's [<a href="https://forvo.com/word/dijkstra/">pronunciation</a>] greedy graph algorithm, where we let the nodes in the networked linked list be the terminals and we let the edges be the airplane flight path from terminal A to terminal Z, where skipping letters is possible.
